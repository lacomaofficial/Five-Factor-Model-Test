## What is the Big Five?

The **Big Five** is one of the most scientifically accepted models of personality psychology. It says that our personalities can be described using **five broad traits**:

- **O**penness
- **C**onscientiousness
- **E**xtraversion
- **A**greeableness
- **N**euroticism

That’s why it’s called the **OCEAN** model.

Each trait is like a spectrum — you're not just one thing or the other. You fall somewhere **along a scale** from low to high. And each trait breaks down into **smaller parts** called **subtraits** or **facets**.

## 🔬 Why Is This Useful?

The Big Five isn’t about **good or bad traits**. It just helps describe **how** people think, feel, and act.

For example:

- A **low Neuroticism** person might stay calm under pressure — great in emergencies.
- A **high Agreeableness** person could thrive in caregiving or teaching roles.
